          <h1>Ayodhya: The Divine Land of Lord Rama‚Äôs Birth</h1>
          <p>
            Ayodhya, one of the holiest cities for Hindus, is revered as the
            birthplace of Lord Rama. Counted among the seven most sacred
            pilgrimage sites in India, this vibrant city of Uttar Pradesh is
            deeply connected with ancient history, mythology, and the Nawabi
            era. Situated on the banks of the Sarayu River, Ayodhya‚Äîhistorically
            called Saketa‚Äîwelcomes devotees and visitors with its timeless
            charm. The city is adorned with grand temples, heritage sites,
            enlightening museums, and serene gardens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buddhist and Jain scriptures also describe Ayodhya as a place visited
            by their spiritual leaders, Lord Buddha and Mahavira. Followers of
            Jainism believe that the city was the birthplace of five
            Tirthankaras: Rishabhanatha, Jitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinatha,
            and Anantanatha.
          </p>

          <div className="highlight-box">
            The grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was inaugurated on January 22, 2024,
            by the Prime Minister of India.

          <h2>About Lord Rama</h2>
          <h1>The Eternal Symbol of Dharma</h1>
          <p>
            Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is worshipped as
            the embodiment of truth, virtue, and righteousness. His story is
            immortalized in the ancient epic <em>Ramayana</em>, where he is
            portrayed as the ideal son, husband, and king. Rama‚Äôs unwavering
            commitment to dharma (righteousness) and his compassion for all
            beings make him a timeless guide for humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            His life journey‚Äîfrom his childhood in Ayodhya, to his exile in the
            forest, his battle with Ravana, and his return as the victorious
            ruler‚Äîsymbolizes the triumph of good over evil. Across generations
            and cultures, Lord Rama is revered as an eternal source of
            inspiration, devotion, and moral strength.
          </p>
          <div className="highlight-box">
            The festival of Ram Navami is celebrated with devotion across India
